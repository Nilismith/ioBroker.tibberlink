## Adapter for Utilizing TIBBER energy data in ioBroker

This adapter facilitates the connection of data from your Tibber account's API to be used within ioBroker, whether for a single home or multiple residences.

If you're not currently a Tibber user, I would greatly appreciate it if you could use my referral link: [Tibber Referral Link](https://invite.tibber.com/mu8c82n5).

## Standard Configuration

-   Begin by creating a new instance of the adapter.
-   You'll also require an API token from Tibber, which you can obtain here: [Tibber Developer API](https://developer.tibber.com).
-   Enter your Tibber API token in the standard settings and configure at least one line for live feed settings (select "None available").
-   Save the settings and exit the configuration to restart the adapter; this step allows your home(s) to be queried from the Tibber server.
-   Return to the configuration screen and select the homes from which you wish to fetch real-time data using your Tibber Pulse. You can also select homes and disable the feed (Note: This works only if the hardware is installed and the Tibber server has verified the connection to Pulse).
-   Save the settings.

## Calculator Configuration

-   Now that the Tibber connection is up and running, you can also leverage the Calculator to incorporate additional automation features into the TibberLink adapter.
-   The Calculator operates using channels, with each channel linked to a selected home.
-   These channels can be activated or deactivated based on corresponding states.
-   These states are designed to serve as external, dynamic inputs for TibberLink, allowing you to, for example, adjust the marginal cost ("TriggerPrice") from an external source or disable the calculator channel ("Active").
-   The states of a calculator channel are positioned adjacent to the home states and named according to the channel number. Hereby the channelname choosen in admin screen is shown here to better identify your configurations.  
    ![Calculator States](docu/calculatorStates.png)
-   The behavior of each channel is determined by its type: "best cost," "best single hours," or "best hours block".
-   Each channel populates an external state as output, which has to be selected in the settings tab. For instance, this state might be "0_userdata.0.example_state" or any other writable external state.
-   The values to be written to the output state can be defined in "value YES" and "value NO," e.g., "true" for boolean states or a number or text to be written.
-   Outputs:
    -   "Best cost": Utilizes the "TriggerPrice" state as input, producing a "YES" output every hour when the current Tibber energy cost is below the trigger price.
    -   "Best single hours": Generates a "YES" output during the least expensive hours, with the number defined in the "AmountHours" state.
    -   "Best hours block": Outputs "YES" during the most cost-effective block of hours, with the number of hours specified in the "AmountHours" state.
    -   "Best cost LTF": "Best cost" within a Limited Time Frame (LTF).
    -   "Best single hours LTF": "Best single hours" within a Limited Time Frame (LTF).
    -   "Best hours block LTF": "Best hours block" within a Limited Time Frame (LTF).
-   LTF channels: Function similarly to standard channels but only operate within a time frame defined by the "StartTime" and "StopTime" state objects. After "StopTime," the channel deactivates itself. "StartTime" and "StopTime" may span over several days. The states must be filled with a date-time string in ISO-8601 format with a timezone offset, such as: "2023-11-17T21:00:00.000+01:00".

### Hint

#### Inverse Usage:

To obtain, for example, peak hours instead of optimal hours, simply invert the usage and parameters:
![Calculator States Inverse](docu/calculatorStatesInverse.png)
By swapping true <-> false, you will receive a true at a low cost in the first line and a true at a high cost in the second line (Channel names are not triggers and are still free to choose).

Attention: For peak single hours, such as in the example, you also need to adjust the number of hours. Original: 5 -> Inverse (24-5) = 19 -> You will obtain a true result during the 5 peak hours.

#### LTF channels:

The calculation is performed for "multiday" data. As we only have information for "today" and "tomorrow" (available after approximately 13:00), the time scope is effectively limited to a maximum of 35 hours. However, it's crucial to be mindful of this behavior because the calculated result may/will change around 13:00 when new data for tomorrow's prices becomes available.

To observe this dynamic change in the time scope for a standard channel, you may opt for a Long-Term Forecast (LTF) spanning several years. This is particularly useful for the "Best Single Hours LTF" scenario.

## Notes

This adapter employs Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers. For more details and information on how to disable error reporting, please consult the [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is initiated starting with js-controller 3.0.
